Sudoku Solver (Easy)
====================

This is a program designed to solve easy sudoku's.
It will not work on harder sudoku's as it makes decisions about cell values by eliminating possibilities based on three rules:
+ If a number already exists in the row, the cell cannot be that number.
+ If a number already exists in the column, the cell cannot be that number.
+ If a number already exists in the box, the cell cannot be that number.

The original puzzle should be expressed with a line for each row, a blank cell represented by a fullstop.
