Sudoku Solver (Easy)
====================

This is a program designed to solve easy sudoku's.
It only uses the *sole candidate* method of adding numbers and hence cannot solve sudoku's that require more complex solving techniques.
The following image shows an example of the *sole candidate* method, where the only possible number for the red box is 5.

The puzzle should be written to a file in same directory with a line for each row, blank cells represented by fullstops.
